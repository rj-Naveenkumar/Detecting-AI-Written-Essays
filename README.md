# BERT-Based Web App for Essay Authorship Classification

This project is a web application that classifies whether an input essay is written by a **human (student)** or **generated by AI** using a fine-tuned BERT model. The app leverages a PyTorch-based BERT classifier on the backend (via Flask) and provides an interactive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Classifies essays into **Student-Written (0)** or **AI-Generated (1)**
- Built with a **fine-tuned BERT (bert-base-uncased)** model
- Interactive web interface
- Real-time response via Flask backend

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Model**: BERT (`bert-base-uncased` from Hugging Face Transformers)
- **ML Framework**: PyTorch
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook for model training

##  How It Works

1. User submits essay via the web form
2. Essay is sent to Flask backend via `POST`
3. Backend loads the trained BERT model and classifies the input
4. Prediction is returned and displayed to the user
